            user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is
            not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of
            them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when
            they receive such signals, the Website currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and
            when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</span>
